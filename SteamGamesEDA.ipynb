As such, it becomes evident that a frequency analysis can provide some insight into the frequency distribution of game release dates. Since there are 4503 unique values of day/month/year, Pandas' built-in plotting struggles to handle axis labels, and as a result, these values were temporarily reduced to a year only value, as this alone is sufficient to understand the change in released game counts over time. Note: Logarithmic scale is used for the number of released games (y-axis) to esnure an insightful bar is plotted for early years (pre-2006) with low release counts.
